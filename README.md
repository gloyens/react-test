## What is this app?

This is a simple to-do list app made using **[this tutorial](https://egghead.io/blog/building-a-crud-app-with-react-and-local-storage)**, in order to help myself learn how to use React.js. Whenever I came across a concept I was unfamiliar with, I would look ask questions to **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)**. As a total beginner, this meant looking up pretty much everything specific to React - props, hooks, components, useState/useEffect and so forth. 

Incidentally, this was the first time I'd used ChatGPT for something like this, and it proved much more helpful than my standard method of looking for specific answers over various blogs and videos. I will definitely do this more often in the future, and I would recommend that others do the same.

## Aim

My main aim when creating this app was to get a general grasp of React in preparation for a coding test. While I would have liked to have spent a  little more time learning, when making this app speed was an issue, and the priority was to get something functional up as soon as possible in order to move on to more bespoke projects.
I chose this particular tutorial for a few reasons:
- It enabled me to create an entire app, start to finish, in a relatively short space of time.
- It assumed that I had prior knowledge of JavaScript
- The result was a functional, useful CRUD app (rather than, for example, an over-simplified game of noughts and crosses).
- The app made use of localstorage, which I hadn't used previously.

## Future Plans

I have no further plans with this specific app; it's mostly served its purpose. From here I'll move on to a new app with similar functionality, but created from scratch with no tutorial.
